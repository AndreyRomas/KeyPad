# KeyPad
This is my DIY project of custom keypad.
Device is based on arduino nano.
Communication between PC and Arduino is based on serial.
Device consists of screen showing PC load, 6 keys which can be programmed from software to act as any PC hotkeys.
Also custom lightning is possible.

There are PCB files included here, but you can also get them or edit them from here: https://easyeda.com/dronromas2/keyboard

This is my first C# software ever so i apologise for any mistakes or ugly code.
